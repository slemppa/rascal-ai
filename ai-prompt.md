# ðŸ§  AI Prompt Guidelines for Cursor

**Always follow these rules:**

- âœ… Do not refactor existing code unless explicitly asked.
- âœ… Minimize changes. Keep logic as-is unless told otherwise.
- âœ… Apply changes *only* to the specified file or component.
- âœ… Never touch unrelated parts of the codebase.
- âœ… Ask for clarification if the prompt is ambiguous.
- âœ… Assume current code is functional and intentional unless stated otherwise.

**Tone:** Precise, minimal, stable.
